# Genix Improvement Proposals (GIPs)

GIP stands for Genix Improvement Proposal. Similar to Bitcoin's [BIPs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/), a GIP is a design document providing information to the Genix community, or describing a new feature for Genix or its processes or environment. The GIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

Because Genix is forked from the Bitcoin codebase, many of the BIPs can be applied to Genix as well (a list of the BIPs updated to include Genix-specific details can be found [here](https://github.com/genix-project/gips)). The purpose of the GIPs is not to duplicate those which exist as BIPs, but to introduce protocol upgrades or feature specifications which are unique to Genix.

## Contributions

We use the same general guidelines for introducing a new GIP as specified in [BIP 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki), with a few differences. Specifically:

* Instead of the BIP editor, initiate contact with the Genix Core development team and your request should be routed to the GIP editor(s). The GIP workflow mimics the BIP workflow.
* Recommended licenses include the MIT license
* Markdown format is the preferred format for GIPs
* Following a discussion, the proposal should be submitted to the GIPs git repository as a pull request. This draft must be written in BIP/GIP style as described in [BIP 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki), and named with an alias such as "GIP-johndoe-infiniteGenix" until the editor has assigned it a GIP number (authors MUST NOT self-assign GIP numbers).
